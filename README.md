This code makes use of my [Custom Java API](https://github.com/Dyndrilliac/java-custom-api). In order to build this source, you should clone the repository for the API using your Git client, then import the project into your IDE of choice (I prefer Eclipse), and finally modify the build path to include the API project. For more detailed instructions, see the README for the API project.

This repository contains the application that was written for the programming project assigned in CAP 4630. The application demonstrates two dimensional A* path-finding around polygonal obstacles. Supply map files with the command line.
